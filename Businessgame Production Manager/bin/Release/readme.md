#Businessgame Production Manager ReadMe
BPM is an independent simulator tool written by one of our users, Wildjap. This simulator simplifies the set up and buying of units for creating a "closed system". This tool enables you to see what your production would look like with a certain company set up, without actually needing to have bought the units.

Once you have tweaked the numbers to a set up you like, the program allows you to automatically buy those missing units to achieve this company set up.

##How to use
Make sure you open your browser and are logged in into Businessgame to be able to utilize the full functionality of the program.

###Load in your company settings
You can import your current company setup by using the "Load Private Data" button which, if you are logged on to businessgame, will automatically load how many units you have of each sector, how muc money you have, how much resources you have of each product and amount free space in warehouse.
