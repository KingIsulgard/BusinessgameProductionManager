#Businessgame Production Manager ReadMe
BPM is an independent simulator tool written by one of our users, Wildjap. This simulator simplifies the set up and buying of units for creating a "closed system". This tool enables you to see what your production would look like with a certain company set up, without actually needing to have bought the units.

Once you have tweaked the numbers to a set up you like, the program allows you to automatically buy those missing units to achieve this company set up.

##How to use
Check the "instructions" button inside the application. More extra detailed information will follow soon here.
